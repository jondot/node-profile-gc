# node-profile-gc

An out of band profiling tool for node, to discover leaks and memory problems. To support stable results, it uses a separate node process with `gc_trace` for sampling runs.

## Quick Start

```
$ yarn add --dev node-profile-gc
```

For now, take a look at [src/__tests__/index.spec.js].
